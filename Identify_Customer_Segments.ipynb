    "# Project: Identify Customer Segments\n",

    "In this project, I apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data used has been provided by partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",

    "Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood. This information will be used to cluster the general population into groups with similar demographic properties. Then, you will see how the people in the customers dataset fit into those created clusters. The hope here is that certain clusters are over-represented in the customers data, as compared to the general population; those over-represented clusters will be assumed to be part of the core userbase. This information can then be used for further applications, such as targeting for a marketing campaign."
